# Plotting Bayesian models with ArviZ

This repository updates an old example of how to fit a Bayesian model in Python and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) (using [CmdStanPy](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy) instead of [PyStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/pystan) and how to plot the results in [ArviZ](https://www.arviz.org)).  

The example is originally from:  
[Statistical Rethinking](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9780429029608/statistical-rethinking-richard-mcelreath):  A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan, 2016, Richard McElreath, CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, ISBN 978-1-4822-5344-3, chapter 5, page 122
